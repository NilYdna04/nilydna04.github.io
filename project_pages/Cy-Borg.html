    <p>
      Cy-Borg Sheet is an online character sheet for the TTRPG Cy-Borg, which is a
      spinoff of another TTRPG known as "Morkborg". This game is no where near as popular
      as DnD, but I really enjoyed the simplicity of the mechanics and the world in which
      it is set in. If you're into TTRPGS, I would definetly recommend trying this one out
      with your friends. The art of the sourcebook is really cool as well!
      <br><br>
      I decided to create this project because there were no online character sheets that allowed
      you to save data for this game. In addition, I needed a project to learn backend web
      development and database programming. So, I got to work on both. Unfortunately, I was only
      able to work on this project for a little bit before having to turn my attnetion to 
      internship projects, so the current sheet is a work in progress. Hopefully I'll be able to complete
      this project now that my internship is over.
