    <h1 class="title">2048 in C++</h1>
    <p>
      Making 2048 in C++ was the first personal project I ever completed. Although I started it over
      my spring break in 2023, I completed it very early on in summer 2023. I didn't have a whole lot of
      experience in any sort of ui, so the game simply runs in terminal and uses terminal
      input to move the grid. In addition, the function used to generate the numbers is the same everytime
      since I just used the C++ rand function.
      <br><br>
      Perhaps when I have time, I'll impliment a better system to run the game, but the 
      core mechanics of 2048 are there, including the scoring system! Im very happy that I was able to create
      an algorithm to combine a row of numbers and came up with a farily clever way to generate new
      numbers in valid spots.
