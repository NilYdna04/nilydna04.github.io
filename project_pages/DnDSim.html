    <p>
      DnDSim was a small project that I completed over my 2023 Summer. For a while,
      I've been into doing various tabletop RPGs, but DnD has always been a favorite of mine
      for both playing and DMing. I am actually a big fan of both the roleplay aspect and 
      combat of DnD, but I always found keeping track of all the information was a little tedious.
      I didn't want to use a full scale online battle simulator, as I like having the battle on a map, but
      at the same time, I found using a spreedsheet or pencil and paper too tedious for larger scale encounters.
      <br><br>
      So, I decided to make this simple program that allows the user to input data for characters, including their initiative.
      Then, the user can enter a command to simulate combat round by round. This program is tailored to what
      I personally want in a tool for combat, so the stats tracked can't be modded or changed in any way. However, maybe I'll add
      more field and make them toggleable, as well as adding a better ui than the terminal if other people wanted to use it. For now, I'll be using this for whenever
      I need to run a combat encounter in my DnD Games!
