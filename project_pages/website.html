      This personal portfolio website is actually my first web dev project! It was created
      from the ground up, with the layout and colors designed by myself. The fonts are free
      fonts I found online. There were multiple styles that I came up with before eventually settling
      with this modern black and white style.
      <br><br>
      I started making this website in the beginning of Summer 2023, and eventually created a working base at about the end. 
      I was doing several other projects during this time, so I wasn't working the entire time. However,
      that doesn't mean I didn't spend a lot of time on this, as I quite literally had 0 experience
      in web dev prior to making this. I would say I came a long way since then in my programming skill, considering 
      I had to self teach myself webdev!
