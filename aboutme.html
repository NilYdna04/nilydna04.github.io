      <p class="paragraph">My name is Andrew Lin and I am a sophmore at Tufts University studying computer science.
      Currently, I am prospective software engineer and fullstack engineer, but this is subject to change. I would consider myself to be a
      fast learner and my skillset to be versatile. I am currently proficent in C++, Python, and HTML, and I will be studying
      C and Assembly over the course of this semseter. I am also learning backend webdev with Javascript. Specifically, I am 
      learning Node and Express, as well as working with database programming.<br><br>
      Outside of studying computer science, my hobbies include video games, anime, reading, and working out at the gym. One of my 
      favorite passtimes is to participate in my college's anime club, in which I have met many talented individuals and made
      many great friends. In addition, I love to take hikes and visit zoos. Ever since I was a kid,
      I've been a huge nature lover and loved to learn about them. <br><br>
      In addition to these things, I love to code! Check out some of my projects <a href="/projects.html">here</a></p>
