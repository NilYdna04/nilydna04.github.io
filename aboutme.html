      <p class="paragraph">My name is Andrew Lin and I am a sophmore at Tufts University studying computer science.
      Currently, I am prospective software engineer and fullstack engineer, but this is subject to change. I would consider myself to be a
      fast learner and my skillset to be versatile. I am currently proficent in C++, Python, and HTML, and I will be studying
      C and Assembly over the course of this semseter.<br><br>
      Outside of studying computer science, my hobbies include video games, anime, reading, and working out at the gym. One of my 
      favorite passtimes is to participate in my college's anime club, in which I have met many talented individuals and made
      many great friends. Getting at least 3 gym sessions a week is another passtime that I very much enjoy to maintain. I am also
      a big nature lover, and love visiting zoos and taking hikes. <br><br>
      In addition to these things, I love to code! </p>
